# CPU Scheduling Simulator
## Overview
This project is a Java-based simulator designed to help visualize and understand CPU scheduling algorithms. It supports various algorithms such as First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), and Round Robin (RR). The simulator provides a user-friendly interface for testing and comparing the performance of these algorithms by showing process execution in real-time.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have the **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed (version 8 or higher).
2. Open the project in a Java-supported IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
3. Navigate to the runnable file located at:
   ```
   C:\OS project master\CPU-SCHEDULING-SIM\src\main\java\SchedulingGUI.java
   ```
4. Run the `SchedulingGUI.java` file to launch the CPU Scheduling Simulator.
5. Choose the desired scheduling algorithm, input process details, and start the simulation to view the execution and performance metrics.
